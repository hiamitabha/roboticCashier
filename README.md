# roboticCashier
Implementation of Anki Vector as a cashier which can detect items that are being bought and process payments for a final bill.

A detailed note on the various aspects of the implentation is available at: https://medium.com/programming-robots/programming-a-robotic-cashier-be9eeb2605dc

This idea is also part of the project in my course: 'Learn AI with a robot'. You can access the course at https://robotics.thinkific.com. It offers an education on AI through the lens of Vector.
